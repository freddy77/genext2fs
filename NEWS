This is the 1.4 pre-release. The new features compared to genext2fs 1.3 are:

- long options support
- support for SI-style suffixes for some option values.
- --faketime option
- more capable device_table.txt format
- hardlink support
- socket support
- big filesystems (>8MB) support
- Solaris 2.x and Mac OS X support

There are also various bugfixes and an up-to-date manpage.

PLEASE NOTE that some options have changed, to try to be consistent
with mkfs.jffs2 and mkfs.ext2: -D replaces the old -f, and -I replaces
the old -i. See the man page for more information.

Please test and report bugs to genext2fs-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
